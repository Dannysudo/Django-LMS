1. Install Pycharm Professional (1 month trial, but free if you sign up as student)
2. When you first open Pycharm, it'll ask "Open Project/ Open Folder" choose the folder where you downloaded the "Project-1"
3. If Pycharm asks to install any packages (like javascript) click yes and wait for it to finish installing 

4. Whenever you start any project, you want to enable a virtual environnment, you do that by typing
"virtualenv venv" into the Pycharm terminal (if  it doesn't work do "pip install virtualenv" first)

4b. To activate virtual environment on windows type "venv\Scripts\activate" for Mac I think it's  "source venv/bin/activate" or "venv/bin/activate"
5. Then install all the packages needed type "pip install -r requirements.txt" into the command console

6. If it asks you to migrate anything in the console, these are the commands.
"python manage.py migrate" or
"python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb"

7. Then enable Front end by entering in terminal
"npm install" and "npm run build"

8. To get started you create a superuser
"python manage.py createsuperuser"

8. Then you run the server, aka to enable Back end.
"python manage.py runserver"

9. To go to the site you hosted type "http://localhost" or "127.0.0.1:8000" into your browser


"npm start"
